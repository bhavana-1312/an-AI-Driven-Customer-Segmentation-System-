## 📌 Project Overview
**MarketMind** is an unsupervised Machine Learning application designed to help retail businesses identify distinct customer segments. By analyzing **Annual Income** and **Spending Scores**, the AI automatically groups customers into 5 distinct behavioral personas (e.g., "VIP Spenders," "Budget Conscious").

This tool moves marketing strategies from "intuition-based" to "data-driven," allowing for hyper-personalized targeting.

## 🚀 Features
* **AI Clustering:** Uses the **K-Means algorithm** to detect hidden patterns in customer data.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with **Streamlit** and **Plotly** for real-time data exploration.
* **Elbow Method:** Visual diagnostic tool to scientifically determine the optimal number of clusters.
* **Consultant Mode:** A prediction interface where managers can input new customer data and get an instant strategy recommendation.
* **Data Export:** Download segmented customer lists as CSV files for marketing campaigns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (K-Means Clustering)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
